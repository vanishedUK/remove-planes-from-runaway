3. Link your `Runway` class file and your Runway test file
4. Write a test suite for the `Runway` class
5. Write a test case that checks that the maximum number of planes allowed on the `Runway` is 100
6. Write a test case that checks you can initialize a `Runway` class with a name
7. Write a test case that validates you can add planes to the `Runway`
8. Write a test case that validates that you receive an error message if you try to add planes to the Runway after it’s at max capacity.
9. Write a test case that validates you can remove planes from the `Runway`
10. Write a test case that validates that you receive an error message if you try to remove planes from the Runway when there are no planes currently in the `Runway`
